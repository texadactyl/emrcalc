Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR) Calculator
==========================================

#### Overview

This project implements a Python 3.7+ Tkinter GUI to facilitate the following EMR calculations which I find useful as a student of Astrophysics:
- Conversion between Energy, Frequency, and Wavelength
- Change the units of any of those 3 characteristics

The package itself can be placed in a pip3 repository, Anaconda3 repository, or simply stored in a directory via download from github.

Some special files in addition to the source code:
- ```HISTORY.txt``` - the update history
- ```SCREENSHOT.png``` - a sample screenshot
- ```url.txt``` - URLs to background information

#### Dependencies:

```
numpy
scipy
tkinter
tkinter.ttk
```

#### Invocation from the command-line while positioned in the folder where the source code is located:

```
python3   emrcalc_main.py
```
